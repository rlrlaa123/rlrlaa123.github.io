Hello there, I'd like to talk about using Git.

I'd say Git is a teamwork-support software that can track the history of revision of codes and upload and deletetion of files.
I know the explanation of it is too vague so I'll show the example.

Below is the picture of Github commit screen. Github is the web service for managing server-side of Git.

So when I upload the file to Github with changed code, it will compare the difference between the previous code(red part) and new code(green part). Do you kind of get the idea?
